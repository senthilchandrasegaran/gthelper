# GT-Helper

GT-Helper is a web-based visual analytics tool to help the qualitative analyst in the Grounded Theory Method.

## What is Grounded Theory?

Grounded Theory is a general method of developing theoretical constructs inductively from data sources gathered as a part of a qualitative research study.
It uses a "construct-oriented approach" where the analyst creates categories based on patterns in the data.
These categories are further grouped into higher-level categories, and relationships (especially causal) between categories are identified.
Finally a "core concept" is chosen among these categories, and based on the relationships identified, a theory is formed.

## What does this tool do?
GT-Helper uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques along with interactive text visualizations to aid the grounded theory method.

## So... what does this tool do, really?
Nothing yet, but watch this space as we explore the possibilities!
