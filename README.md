# Textplorer

Textplorer is a web-based visual analytics tool to help the qualitative analyst in the Grounded Theory Method.
Grounded Theory is a general method of developing theoretical constructs
inductively from data sources gathered as a part of a qualitative
research study.
It uses a "construct-oriented approach" where the analyst creates
categories based on patterns in the data.
These categories are further grouped into higher-level categories, and
relationships (especially causal) between categories are identified.
Finally a "core concept" is chosen among these categories, and based on
the relationships identified, a theory is formed.

Textplorer uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques along with
interactive text visualizations to help the user explore the text data,
identify concepts of interest, and establish relationships between these
concepts.

## Installation Instructions
We use the Stanford Parts-of-Speech (POS) Tagger and the Stanford Named
Entity Recognition (NER) Tagger, which require a little setup in Java.
So before installing Textplorer, perform the following steps first.

### Install Stanford NER & POS Taggers

1. Install JDK (v > 1.8), and add the path to the bin file (e.g.
  `C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_101/bin` or `/usr/bin/java` to the environment variable `JAVAHOME` (for Windows), or to your `$PATH` variable (for Linux/OSX).
2. Download the [Stanford Named Entity Recognizer](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html#Download)
  and extract its contents to a folder, say `$HOME/StanfordNER/`
3. Add `$HOME/StanfordNER` to the `CLASSPATH` environment variable (for
   windows) or to your `$PATH` variable if linux/OSX.
4. Download the [Stanford CoreNLP models](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-english-corenlp-2018-10-05-models.jar)
  and extract the files. Copy the folder `nlp` from
  `stanford-english-corenlp-20YY-MM-DD/edu/stanford/` and place it in
  `$HOME/StanfordNER`.
5. Download the [Stanford POS Tagger]() and place it in a folder, say
   `$HOME/StanfordPOS`. Add this folder to your `$PATH` variable.
6. Make sure Node.js and Python are installed on your system
7. Install the [NLTK package](http://www.nltk.org/install.html) for
  Python.
8. Run python and the command line and type ``import nltk``, followed by
   ``nltk.download()``. This opens a download window titled "nltk
   downloader". Select the "Corpora" tab, and download the "wordnet_ic",
   and "stopwords" corpora by double-clicking on each. Close the window.

### Install Textplorer
Textplrorer's server uses the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runtime, so
it needs to be installed first, in order to install all related
libraries.

1. Download the source code
  [as a zip file](https://github.com/senthilchandrasegaran/textplorer/archive/master.zip)
  or clone the repository by typing the following command on the terminal:

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/senthilchandrasegaran/textplorer.git
   ```

2. On the Node.js Command Prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for OS X), navigate to the main folder (the one that contains the file `textplorer.js`) and type in:

   ```shell
   $ npm install
   ```

This installs all required modules.

**NOTE:**
It is wise to update the path variables in the file
`public/pythonscripts/infoContent.py` to reflect the paths of the
Stanford NER and POS Taggers, instead of relying on the `$PATH` variable setting. Make sure you have the absolute path (paths starting with `~/` or `$HOME` will not work.
